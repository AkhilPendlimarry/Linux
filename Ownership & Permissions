We have 3 types of ownership in Linux.

User : One who created the file/folder. denoted by u
Group: A group of users the file belongs to. Denoted by g
Others: Anyone other than user and group. denotes by o

Whenever a user is created in Linux, a group with same name also created by default.

Permissions : 3 types.
    Read - denotes by number 4
    Write - denoted by 2
    Execute - denoted by 1
    
        -rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  126 May 31 09:45 hosts
        
  Above line has total 10 characters. First character shows it is a File(-)
   next 3 characters denotes permission of user.
   next 3 characters denotes permission of group.
   next 3 characters denotes permission of other.
   
   So user has read and write access.
   Group has read access.
   others has read access.
   
   If we want to add execute permission to everyone.
        chmod ugo+x <file-name>
        
   If we want to add write permission only to user and group.
        chmod ug+w <file-name>
        
   If we want to remove executive access to all.
        chmod ugo-x <file-name>
        
        
   we can also use letters i.e., R + W = 4 + 2 = 6;
                                 R + W + X = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7;
   Below line denotes read access to user and no access to group and others.
        chmod 400 <file-name>
