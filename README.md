# Linux     
I am creating a Linux server in AWS cloud. Using free trail of AWS account.
Note:  Delete/ Stop the servers after practicing.
Make sure your security group has access to port number 22.
Once you create the server, you need to use ssh command to login to the server

ssh -i <pem-file-path> username@IP-address
  Here in Linux, 
  $ - denotes Normal user
  # - denotes root user.
